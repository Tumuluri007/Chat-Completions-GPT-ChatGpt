**OpenAI API Chat Completions Demo**
This repository demonstrates the usage of **OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model through the Chat Completions API**. The code showcases various applications of the API, including general conversation, sentiment analysis, and joke generation.
**Key Features:**
Interactive Prompts: Users can input their own prompts for the AI to respond to.
Sentiment Analysis: Demonstrates how to use the API for classifying text sentiment.
Temperature Control: Shows how to adjust the randomness of AI responses using the temperature parameter.
Full Response Printing: Displays the complete API response for educational purposes.
**Code Breakdown:**
General Conversation: Uses the default system message "You are a helpful assistant" to engage in open-ended dialogue.
Sentiment Analysis: Employs a custom system message to classify user input as positive or negative.
Joke Generation: Demonstrates using a low temperature (0.2) for more focused and deterministic responses.
**Technical Details:**
API Used: OpenAI's Chat Completions API
Model: GPT-3.5-turbo
Language: Python
Dependencies: OpenAI Python library
**Usage:**
Set up your OpenAI API key as an environment variable.
Run the script and follow the prompts to interact with different functionalities.
Observe both the AI's responses and the full API output for each interaction.
**Educational Value:**
This code serves as a practical example for developers looking to integrate OpenAI's powerful language models into their applications. It demonstrates key concepts such as:
Structuring API requests with different system and user messages
Handling API responses
Customizing model behavior through parameters like temperature
**Note on API Key Security:**
This code assumes the OpenAI API key is set as an environment variable. Always keep your API key secure and never commit it directly in your code.
**Future Enhancements:**
Implement error handling for API calls
Add more diverse examples of API usage (e.g., text summarization, code generation)

Write the code and check for errors in Notepad++ Download Version 8.6.8 On Windows.
